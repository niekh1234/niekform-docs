In this guide we will cover setting up NiekForm using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/).

This guide will assume you set up some sort of SMTP server. If you don't have one, you can use [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/) or [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/). Make sure to verify your sender email address.
