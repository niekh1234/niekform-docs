# Getting started

Welcome again, this is the place to find all the information you need to get started with NiekForm.

## Fork the NiekForm repository

Head over to our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/niekh1234/niekform) and fork the repository, while you're at it, give it a star as well :smile:

## The choice is yours

This is your last chance, after this there is no going back. You take the blue pill, the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill, you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.

You can either install NiekForm on your own server, or you can self manage using cloud based providers which often provide free tiers. An example is [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) with [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/) or something like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) with [Supabase](https://supabase.io/).
