# Protecting web forms with HoneyPots

As a form builder, NiekForm is designed to make it easy for developers to create and implement forms on their websites and applications. However, one of the biggest challenges of working with forms is protecting them from spam. Spam submissions can clog up your form data and make it difficult to find and process legitimate submissions. This is where NiekForm's honeypot technology comes in.

A honeypot is a hidden field in a form that is designed to trap spam submissions. It works by adding a field to the form that is invisible to human users but easily visible to spam bots. When a spam bot fills out the form, it includes information in the honeypot field, which NiekForm's spam filter can then use to detect and reject the spam submission.

## The Advantages of Honeypots

Honeypots are a highly effective way of combating spam, as they do not rely on traditional spam filters that can be easily circumvented by sophisticated spam bots. Instead, honeypots use a more direct approach, trapping the spam bots before they have a chance to submit their spam. This makes them a highly effective way of protecting your forms from spam.

## NiekForm's Honeypot Technology

NiekForm uses honeypots as part of its built-in spam filter. When a form is created using NiekForm, a honeypot field is automatically added to the form. This field is invisible to users but easily detectable by spam bots, making it a highly effective tool in the fight against spam.

One of the great things about NiekForm's honeypot technology is that it is completely self-hosted and open source. This means that you have complete control over your form data, and can modify the code to fit your specific needs. NiekForm also provides documentation and support for its honeypot technology, making it easy for developers to implement and use.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, NiekForm's honeypot technology is a highly effective tool for protecting your forms from spam. By using honeypots as part of its built-in spam filter, NiekForm provides a direct and effective way of combating spam submissions. And with NiekForm being open source and self-hosted, you have complete control over your form data, making it a great choice for developers looking for a flexible and secure form builder.
